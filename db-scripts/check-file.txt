Maharshi Vyas	VAINI BAKSHI	Vaini needs deeper clarity on the nuances of HRBP roles, Founder’s Office roles, and General Management programs. Currently, her understanding of HRBP is surface-level and limited to operational HR. Her introduction also lacks punch—it reads like “one of many recruiters.” The resume needs to highlight impact, not activities. To move into strategic roles, she must strengthen her understanding of core HR concepts, various org structures, and resource planning frameworks.	"She is targeting:

HRBP roles

Talent Acquisition

Her expectations are fair—targeting 20–22L CTC, aligned with her HR experience. However, we’ve advised her to remain open to structured Management Trainee or Founder’s Office roles even at 18L+, if the brand and learning curve are solid. She can articulate her experience well and is willing to be flexible if the right opportunity comes."

But her vision is currently limited to HR roles. We’ve nudged her to explore Founder’s Office and MT roles where her youth, agility, and coachability give her a real edge. She shows a fair grasp of her transferable skills.	"She’s run the full recruitment lifecycle across both staffing and in-house HR, giving her perspective from both ends

Story is real, hands-on, not theoretical

She’s coachable, open to feedback, and quick to absorb new perspectives

These traits position her well for early-career acceleration roles that demand hustle, adaptability, and execution capability."	"HRBP Roles – With deeper business orientation, she can be a strong strategic HRBP, especially in high-growth companies.

Founder’s Office – If she sharpens her business lens, she can thrive in execution-heavy Founder’s Office roles with direct CXO exposure.

Management Trainee Programs – She’s the youngest in the batch, which makes her uniquely positioned for MT roles that prefer 2–4 years of work experience and fresh leadership potential.

These are roles where the rest of the batch might not qualify—but she can stand out if the positioning is right."	"Plan B – General Management roles in conglomerates with rotation-based learning

Plan C – HRBP roles in fast-scaling startups

Plan D – Strategic staffing roles in firms like ABC Consultants, Michael Page, or PeopleStrong. With her execution skills and exposure, she can lead a vertical for them in 4–5 years"
